## Week 1
### task 
- perform cleansing on multiple CSV files you have found online and augment them into one spreadsheet. 
  - When you concatenate the instances from different csv files, you need to unify all possible features/attributes the way you described. 
- perform scatter plots on across multiple attributes for visualization
### resource
- This is the <a href="https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_sub-national_real-time_epidemiological_and_vaccination_database_for_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Canada/13480383" target="_top">link</a> of the COVID-19 data.
- This data has been added to this project too.
- You may find some ideas from <a href="https://adamtheautomator.com/read-csv-python/#Reading_CSV_Files_with_Python" target="_top">Read CSV in Python</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python#question3" target="_top">Data frame</a>.
- I tried to write a [demo](https://github.com/similato87/COVID19Preprocess/blob/master/main/pipeline.py) for reading data, and it seems to be successful.
### note
- The next meeting will be Monday at 12 noon at H133.
